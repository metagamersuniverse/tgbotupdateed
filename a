🚨 Important Reminder 🚨

❌ Admins will not message you privately to solve problems.
🔑 Do not share confidential information in private chats or make any transactions.
❗️ Do not connect your wallet to any links.
🧩 Anyone claiming to be an admin who messages you first in a private message is a scammer.
👉 Always verify admins with an admin tag.
Stay safe and be cautious of scams. Thank you.
